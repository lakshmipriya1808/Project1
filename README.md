# Project1
Overview
The Loan Eligibility System is a machine learning project aimed at predicting the eligibility of loan applicants. By leveraging historical data, the system evaluates applicants based on various features to determine their likelihood of loan approval.
Models
Random Forest Classifier
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training. It provides robust results but, in this project, it yielded lower accuracy compared to Naive Bayes.

Naive Bayes Classifier
Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem with strong independence assumptions between the features. In this project, the Naive Bayes classifier achieved higher accuracy, making it the preferred model for predicting loan eligibility.
